# rstudio-ml

RStudio with Machine Learning dependencies, based on [Rocker RStudio ML Docker container](https://hub.docker.com/r/rocker/ml) for CyVerse VICE. VICE requires additional configuration files (e.g. `nginx`) to be compatible with our Condor and Kubernetes orchestration. 


# Instructions

## Run this Docker locally or on a Virtual Machine

To run these containers, you must first pull them from DockerHub

```
docker pull cyversevice/rstudio-ml:latest
```

```
docker run -it --gpus all --rm -v /$HOME:/app --workdir /app -p 8787:80 -e REDIRECT_URL=http://localhost:8787 cyversevice/rstudio-ml:latest
```

The default username is `rstudio` and password is `rstudio1`. To reset the password, add the flag `-e PASSWORD=<yourpassword>` in the `docker run` statement.

## Build your own Docker container and deploy on CyVerse VICE

This container is intended to run on the CyVerse data science workbench, called [VICE](https://cyverse-visual-interactive-computing-environment.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/index.html). 

Unless you plan on making changes to this container, you should just use the existing launch button above. 

###### Developer notes

To build your own container with a Dockerfile and additional dependencies, pull the pre-built image from DockerHub:

```
FROM cyversevice/rstudio-ml:latest
```

Follow the instructions in the [VICE manual for integrating your own tools and apps](https://cyverse-visual-interactive-computing-environment.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/developer_guide/building.html).
